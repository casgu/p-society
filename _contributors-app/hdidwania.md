project:
- |
    - [Text Generator](https://github.com/hdidwania/Text-Generator): Use of LSTM to build a Deep Learning model, able to generate meaningful sentences, similar to text it is trained on.

- |
    - [Flower Recognition](https://github.com/hdidwania/Flower-Recognition): Use of transfer learning to make a model, pretrained for imagenet classification task, able to learn a new task i.e. classification of flowers from images.

- |
    - [Spam Classifier](https://github.com/hdidwania/Spam-Classifier-Naive-Bayes): Use of Naive Bayes classification algorithm to make a classifier to label mails/messages as spam or ham.

- |
    - [Digit Detection](https://github.com/hdidwania/): Use of YOLO algorithm to detect and localize numerical digits appearing in an image. (Code will be open sourced soon).



volunteer_experience: |
 - I mentor juniors and take sessions on topics related to Machine Learning as a member of Programming Society IIIT-Bh.

 - I help juniors with robotics and microcontrollers as a member of Technetronic, IIIT-Bh.

 - I helped in organising various tech events undertaken by Tech Society, IIIT-Bh. Served as a volunteer in robotics events in Advaita, the tech fest of the institute.
