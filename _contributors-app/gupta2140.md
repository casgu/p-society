    - Most of the projects I've done are open source under KDE and not personal. However, would not like to list my personal projects yet (still under development and not ready, but will soon finish and share them).

 - Got selected and sponsored for attending **KDE World Conference AKADEMY 2018 in Vienna, Austria** and give a talk there on my works with KDE.

 - When having an knack to do something interesting, I drop Open source contributions for sometime and do competitive coding. I had participated in Deloitte Code Gladiators in 2017 and ranked 33 in India in the 1st round.

 - I also went to the ACM ICPC Regionals.

 - I am a member of the Programming Society of IIIT-Bh. Together we try to guide the first years in getting started with software development and aim to build the coding culture of our college.

 - I help in organizing various sessions, contests and events by the Programming Society.

 - I've also taken some sessions guiding juniors on Open Source development and Competitive coding.
